This is the backend implementation of the Live Questions iOS app, which showcases the power and simplicity of using the Booster framework as a backend solution. 


## This project showcases
- **Event driven design:** 
The server is designed to process and respond to events rather than traditional requests, making it highly efficient as it can process multiple events concurrently and asynchronously.
- **Event sourcing and CQRS:** 
Stores all changes to the state of the backend as a sequence of events, like an event log, rather than in a traditional database, and use CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate the responsibilities of handling commands (inputs) and read models (outputs).
- **Domain-driven design:** 
Focus on defining the system in terms that are understandable by all stakeholders and breaking it down into small, cohesive components that represent different business entities and their relationships.
- **GraphQL API:** 
Booster generates a fully-working GraphQL API for your backend clients to use, without you worrying about writing resolvers or maintaining your GraphQL schema.
- **Scalability and reliability:** 
Booster offers scalability and reliability for high volume request and event handling, ensuring data consistency and availability through the use of cloud resources such as Lambdas, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

## Quick Start

Here are some steps you can follow to download and run the application locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/theam/livequestions-booster.git
$ cd livequestions-booster
$ npm install
$ boost start -e local 
```

For testing in local or development environments, we suggest using the Altair GraphQL client. Simply enter the endpoint URL for your application, which is located at http://localhost:3000/graphql. It will also load the documentation for your API schema!

Note that if you are testing some Commands locally and donâ€™t want to deal with the authentication part (we explain authentication later in the article), you can just keep the Command public and authorize it for â€˜allâ€™:

```
@Command({
authorize: 'all'
})
export class CreateTopic {â€¦}
```

Keep in mind that subscriptions are currently not supported in a local environment. For that, you need to deploy the application to AWS, as explained in the Booster documentation.
