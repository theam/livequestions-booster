This is the backend implementation of the Live Questions iOS app, which showcases the power and simplicity of using the Booster framework as a backend solution. 


## This project showcases
- **Event driven design:** 
The server is designed to process and respond to events rather than traditional requests, making it highly efficient as it can process multiple events concurrently and asynchronously.
- **Event sourcing and CQRS:** 
Stores all changes to the state of the backend as a sequence of events, like an event log, rather than in a traditional database, and use CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate the responsibilities of handling commands (inputs) and read models (outputs).
- **Domain-driven design:** 
Focus on defining the system in terms that are understandable by all stakeholders and breaking it down into small, cohesive components that represent different business entities and their relationships.
- **GraphQL API:** 
Booster generates a fully-working GraphQL API for your backend clients to use, without you worrying about writing resolvers or maintaining your GraphQL schema.
- **Scalability and reliability:** 
Booster offers scalability and reliability for high volume request and event handling, ensuring data consistency and availability through the use of cloud resources such as Lambdas, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
